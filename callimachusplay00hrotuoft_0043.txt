CALLIMACHUS 33
fuse my life and deliberately choose
death For I would rather not exist at
all than have to go on living' in such an
overwhelming atmosphere of grace and
virtue.

(Fortunatus falls back )
ST JOHN O what amazing and de-
vilish jyealous ῖ What spite on the part
xl of the old Serp ent who long ago pro-
fered the cup οἳ death to our forefathers
and even top this day groans over the
trium h of the ri ghteousl This miser-
abIe ortunatuS‚ chock- full of the gall
of Satan' s venom is like a rotten tree
that brings forth bitter fruit. Therefore
let him be cut off from the brotherhood
of the righteouS, and cast out from the
society of those that fear God! Let him
be consigned to the flames of everlast-
ing punishment, there to be tormented
without resp ite or refreshment!
AND Lookp‚ look, the wounds madeby
the snake are all swelling up! He is
collapsing again* Why he will be dead
before the word is out of my mouth!
ST JOHN Let him die, and dwell in
hell. He deserves it for refusing his life
simply through envy of another's good
