AND. Please explain more clearly what
ou mean.

T. JOHN. Well, anyone who is proud
must be enviouS, and anyone who is en-

are more virtuous than itself. At the
same time it scorns to be thought un-
equal to its superiorS‚ and proudly tries
to a pear superior to its equaIS.

ST. JOHN. That was why this wret-
ched creature felt so cut to the heart -

than our two friends here. He simply
could not see that God’s grace was shin-
ing in them with fuller light.
