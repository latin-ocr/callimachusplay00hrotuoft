CALLIMACHUS

Α2Ν1) That‚ I take it, is why we fail to
appreciate those judgements It is be-
cause we can never get a complete know-
Iedg e of the cause of any event
STg JOHN YeS, too often the sequel
alone can show us its real significante
AND. But come now blessed John and
do what you were sent to do Restore
Callimachus to life and so assist to solve
this perplexing mystery
ST JOHN (dubiously) I fancy... the
first thing to dom is to scare away that
snake.. bgy calling on Christ' s name
Afterwards I can go on to restore Cal-
limachus
AND Quite right Then he will be in
no danger of getting a second bite
ST JOHN Cruel monster depart from
this young man! He is marked for ser-
vice to Christ

(The snake retreatS.)
AND Well the brute may be lacking
in reason, but at any rate it is not deas!
It has obeyedy our command
ST JOHN It was Christ' s authority,
not mine that made it give way
AND That must be why it disappeared
so quickly- almost before you spoke
