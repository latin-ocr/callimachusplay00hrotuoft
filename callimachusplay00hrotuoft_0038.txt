28 CALLIMACHUS.

son CallimachuS, who of His mercy
doomed you to die, and by dooming you
to die has made you live again, to the
end that by this likeness of death He
might deliver the work of His hands
from spiritual destruction!

- AND. What a paradox - it should give

us all food for wonder!

ST. JOHN. O Christ, redeemer of the
world and sacrifice for our sinS, I know
not in what terms of praise to glorify
Thee sufficiently. I tremble at the very
thought of Thy bounteous mercv and
merciful patience - Thou who at one
time cherishest the sinner with a fat-
her's forbearance, and at another com—
pellest him to repentance by the merited
harshness of his punishment!

ANP. Praise be to His divine compas-
s1on.

ST. JOHN. Who could have dared to
believe or presumed to hope that a man
like this, caught in the very act of crime
by death and by death snatched away,
would by Thy pitv be deerned worthy
of being restored to life and brought to
repentance‘.2 Blessed be Thy Holy Name
throughout all ages - Thou who alone
