CALLIMACHUS 23
ST JOHN O infinite and illimitable
God uncompounded and incalculable
essence Thou who alone art what
Thou art Thou who by' joining two op-
posites in one canst from them create
man, and yet again by severing them in
sunder canst to his elements man dis-
perse; command now that the breath
return into this body that this disor-
dered frame be once more welded in one,
and that Callimachus rise again a per-
fect man, as he was before - whereby
Thou, who alone doest great marveIS‚
mayest be glorified of all the world!
AND. Amen....But look! He lives! His
breath is coming again! I't is only stup-
efaction that keeps him still lying there.
ST. JOHN (taking Callimachus by the
hand). Arise, CallimachuS‚ in the name
of Christ, and confess what has hap-
pened! Tell us any sins of which you
may be guilty, in order that we may have
before us nothing but the whole truth.
CALLIMACHUS. I cannot deny that
I came here With the intention of com-
mitting a crime. For I was out of my
wits with worry and misery and could
not restrain the wave of lawless passion
