30 v CALLIMACHUS.

crime,

ST. JOHN· But you ought not to grudge
him the favour of God’s mercv.
CALL. No, but a man proved guilty of
the ruin of another does not deserve to
be restored to life.

ST. JOHN. The law of our religion
teaches us that a man must forgive his
brother’s trespass if he expects God to

forgive his own -
AND. That is only fair.

ST. JOHN. For the only-begotten Son
of God, the first—born of the Virgin‚ He
who alone came into the world innocent,
spotleSS‚ and without taint of original
sin, actually found all mankind bowed

down under the grievous weight of sin -
AND. It is true.

ST, JOHN. I suppose He could not find
a single upright man, or a single man
really deserving of mercv3 and yet He
despised no one, He shut no one out
from the favour of His compassion3 but
He offered Himself on behalf of all, and
laid down for us His own precious life.

AND. YeS‚ and if He had not been put
to death without a cause, no one could
rightfully have been saved from death.
